            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Service Provider has respected the privacy of users and has been
              well aware that users intended to receive security in using applications, and the data obtained by the Service
              Provider under the agreed terms and conditions shall be used for the purpose of users only, and the Service Provider
              shall operate its businesses under the strict measures of security protection, including prevention from any use
              of the data without receiving prior permissions from users.
            </p>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Privacy Policy, as appeared below, shall be applicable to accounts

                  <p>Regarding the registration or use of services on applications, the Service Provider needed to ask for the personal
                    data of users such as first names and last names, email addresses, cellphone numbers, addresses, etc., for
                    continuous operation of the application system. In case, users have exercised their rights to redeem points
                    for rewards and privileges, the Service Provider may ask for additional personal data such as genders, date
                    of birth, addresses, personal preferences, etc. Users acknowledged that the personal data completed for use
                    on applications shall be sent through the Internet which is the public networking system; whereas, the Service
                    Provider shall use measures and its due care to prevent the third parties from accessing such personal data.
                    However, the Service Provider reserved its rights to assume no responsibility for any damage resulting from
                    the third partiesâ€™ viewing and/or use of such data of users.

                  <p> Users shall have their rights of privacy in their data, and the Service Provider shall not permit any disclosure
                    of data of users to the third parties other than employees authorized by the Service Provider. The Service
